HTML & CSS Capstone Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my application of the knowledge I have obtained of core HTML and CSS concepts.  I have decided to build a website discussing the beauty and allure of abandoned places.  I will be building a 4 page website with the below 4 parameters at a minimum:

Page 1
- Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
- 1 header using H1
- 3 sections of text with H2 headers
- 1 image

Page 2
- Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
HTML form with a minimum of:
- 1 fieldset
- 3 inputs
- 2 text
- 1 checkbox
- 1 textarea
- Appropriate labels for the above
- 1 button

Page 3
- Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
- 1 header using H1
- 1 ordered or unordered list of links to 5 other websites

Page 4
- Navigation Bar linking to all 4 pages
- 1 header using H1
- 6 images displayed 3 wide and 2 down
- A label for each image
- Clicking on the image opens the source of that image in a new window
